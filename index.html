    <h2 id="about">Hi there!</h2>
    <p>My name is Shohreh, and I am originally from Iran, but I live in the United Kingdom. I have a lot of hobbies, but today, I only tell you about one of them: Nature! </p>

    <h2>🤔 How it all started ...</h2>

    <p> Going to the university was one of the highlights of my life. My university was located in the beautiful city of Lahijan. Some days, I could see the stunning "Sheytan-Kooh" from the windows of my classroom. "Sheytan-Kooh" translates as the "Mountain of Devil" in English, and I think that's a perfect place for an Atheist to be.</p>

    <p>I cannot say the first semester was very welcoming, nevertheless, it was better than school, and much better than being at home.<br>
      Gradually, I built a strong relationship with some of my classmates, and my university professors. They were always ready to answer our questions, and taught me how to love trees, plants, and forests.<br>
      And that's how my love towards nature shaped...</p>

    <h2>Persian Ironwood!</h2>
    <p> One of my university professors mentioned that there are only four tree species which are endemic to Iran, while the other one emphasized about importance of having diverse colours in the forest. He explained how Parrotia persica which is known as "Anjili" in Iran, changes its colours during different seasons.<br>
      Therefore, when it came to choosing a tree as a part of our research project, I chose "Parrotia persica" which is also known as "Persian Ironwood".</p>

    <p>
      I was amazed how little information is available about this tree in Persian resources.<br>
      Searching in the university library was not that successful, therefore, I was left with no choice other than looking into foreign resources.<br>
      Living in a country like Iran, without having access to a credit card, or even knowing about the importance of copyright rule, can be really challenging.<br>
      At the end, I somehow got access to an English e-book which was explaining about Parrotia persica in Kew Garden, as well as in British Columbia streets.<br>
      One challenge is cotrolling the trunk of this tree, since it tends to grow multi-stemmed, but the e-book claims that Canadian were so successful in controlling the tree that Parrotia persica became a beautiful street tree in British Columbia.<br>
      I asked myself:
      Why not in Iran?<span class="ending-clause"> To be continued...</span>
